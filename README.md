# Leave-Management-System

<p align = "justify"> A world without trees, without paper, if imagined would
look devastating, especially if there are a lot of people
writing letters just to take a leave! We bring to you a tool
that will help curb the wastage of paper by asking students
to enter the various details in a form specifically designed
by us, and maintaining the details and info in a database,
which will also make it easier for the teachers to manage
the students, thus saving a lot of time. </p>

<p align = "justify"> The details entered in the application window will be reflected onto the excel file present in the current folder on submission. </p>
